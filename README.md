Description: <br />
A basic calculator for your needs! If you've gotten this far, thank you for checking out my application. =]

Compilation/Installation: <br />
It's easy to compile and install this application. This is all you need to do, depending on your OS ~

Linux - <br />
Download, save, and extract the source code > open a terminal from within the archive > type "make" without quotes > type "./Calculator" without quotes.

Windows/Mac OS -  <br />
There are a few different ways to install this application on Windows and Mac OS, but this method may be the easiest: Download, save, and extract the source code > download and install the latest Qt Creator IDE along with the Qt 5.12 Framework > Click "Open Project" on the Welcome page > Navigate tot he Calculator.pro file > In the botton left of the screen, click the "Build" button (it looks like a hammer). An executable binary file Calculator.exe will be built.

That's it! Your copy of the program should compile to an executable binary file that can be run on your desktop machine.

Updates: <br />
Check this README.md file for version updates. I may improve the code/documentation and add more features over time.
