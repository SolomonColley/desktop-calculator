Description:
A basic calculator for your needs! If you've gotten this far, thank you for checking out my application. =]

Compilation/Installation:
It's easy to compile and install this program. This is all you need to do: download the source code > unzip the archive > open a terminal/command prompt from within the archive > type "make" without quotes.

That's it! Your copy of the program should compile to an executable binary file that can be run on your desktop machine.

Updates:
Check this README.md file for version updates. I may improve the code/documentation and add more features over time.
